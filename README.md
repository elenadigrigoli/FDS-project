## Project Description

Effective waste management is crucial to address environmental challenges and support sustainable development. Automated classification of waste using image recognition can significantly enhance the efficiency of recycling processes and reduce human intervention. 
This study aims to contribute to these efforts by exploring multiple approaches to waste classification.
